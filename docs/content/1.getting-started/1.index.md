description: Deploy the GitHub Actions Cache Server using Docker and use it with self-hosted runners
---

The cache server comes as a Docker image and can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## 1. Deploying the Cache Server

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
version: '3.9'

services:
  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      URL_ACCESS_TOKEN: random_token
      API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000
    volumes:
      - cache-data:/data

volumes:
  cache-data:
```

### Environment Variables

#### `URL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

This token is used to authenticate runtime requests to the cache server. It should be a long random string. It is part of the URL used to access the cache server because we cannot use cookies or headers for authentication.

#### `API_BASE_URL`

- Example: `http://localhost:3000`

The base URL of your cache server. This needs to be accessible by your runners as it is used for making API requests and downloading cached files.

#### `STORAGE_DRIVER`

- Default: `filesystem`

The storage driver to use for storing cache data. For more information, see [Storage Drivers](/getting-started/storage-drivers).

#### `DB_DRIVER`

- Default `sqlite`

The database driver to use for storing cache metadata. For more information, see [Database Drivers](/getting-started/database-drivers).

#### `NITRO_PORT`

- Default: `3000`

The port the server should listen on.

## 2. Using with Self-Hosted Runners

To leverage the GitHub Actions Cache Server with your self-hosted runners, you'll need to configure a couple of environment variables on your runners. This ensures that your runners can authenticate with and utilize the cache server effectively.

### Configuring Environment Variables on Self-Hosted Runners

**`ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`**: This tells your self-hosted runner where to send cache requests. Set this environment variable to the `API_BASE_URL` of your cache server with the `URL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as first path parameter, making sure to include a trailing slash.

For example, if your cache server's `API_BASE_URL` is `http://localhost:3000` and your `URL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is `random_token`, you would set `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` to `http://localhost:3000/random_token/`.

### Getting the Actions Runner to Use the Cache Server

The default self-hosted runner overwrites the `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` environment variable with the GitHub-hosted cache server URL. To get the runner to use your self-hosted cache server, you'll need to modify the runner binary:

#### Docker

Just add the following lines to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile [Dockerfile]
FROM ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner:latest

# modify actions runner binaries to allow custom cache server implementation
RUN sed -i 's/\x41\x00\x43\x00\x54\x00\x49\x00\x4F\x00\x4E\x00\x53\x00\x5F\x00\x43\x00\x41\x00\x43\x00\x48\x00\x45\x00\x5F\x00\x55\x00\x52\x00\x4C\x00/\x41\x00\x43\x00\x54\x00\x49\x00\x4F\x00\x4E\x00\x53\x00\x5F\x00\x43\x00\x41\x00\x43\x00\x48\x00\x45\x00\x5F\x00\x4F\x00\x52\x00\x4C\x00/g' /home/runner/bin/Runner.Worker.dll
```

#### Bare Metal

```bash [Terminal]
sed -i 's/\x41\x00\x43\x00\x54\x00\x49\x00\x4F\x00\x4E\x00\x53\x00\x5F\x00\x43\x00\x41\x00\x43\x00\x48\x00\x45\x00\x5F\x00\x55\x00\x52\x00\x4C\x00/\x41\x00\x43\x00\x54\x00\x49\x00\x4F\x00\x4E\x00\x53\x00\x5F\x00\x43\x00\x41\x00\x43\x00\x48\x00\x45\x00\x5F\x00\x4F\x00\x52\x00\x4C\x00/g' /path_to_your_runner/bin/Runner.Worker.dll
```

This will replace the strings `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` with `ACTIONS_CACHE_ORL` in the runner binary. This will prevent the runner from overwriting the `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` environment variable and allow it to use your self-hosted cache server.

Doing it this way is a bit of a hack, but it's easier than compiling your own runner binary from source and works great.
